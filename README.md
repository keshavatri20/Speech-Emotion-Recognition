# Speech-Emotion-Recognition
 a model that takes the audio input just like human ears, and then process it through some Machine Learning algorithm, we can then classify the emotion that the given speech dictates.
the algorithm that classifies the speech into a number of emotions i.e neutral, calm, happy, sad, angry, fearful, disgust, surprised. We divide this project
into two parts. The first part is to decide what are the main features, how to extract the features from the input audio and how to filter them. The
second part is to give these features to a suitable classification model.
